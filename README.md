Prject description -- As part of my learning, this project designed to help me understand and demonstrate my knowledge of HTML and CSS -- 

Objective:
The objective of building this personal website is for it to act as my portfolio as I begin my programming journey to become a developer. 

Key goals:
The portfolio I want to have is simple and clean. 
I wanted the portfolio to tell the audience a little about why I am here on this journey, a little insight to my personality/interest and also what I envision the future to be. 

Portfolio:
It is segmented into 3 pages. 
-About- is also the home page. This is where I want to audience to know why I am here. It is also important to me I make a special acknowledgement to my spouse as we needed to make a lot of sacrifices as a family for me to do this. He has been extremely supportive and helps out tremendously with the kids. The mum guilt is still hard to manage but I feel better knowing their dad is 100% with them. 
-My joy- is where I let the audience know a little something they don't know about me. An insight into my personality and interest.
-My dream- This page tells the audience about what I am envisioning for the future. 

Next steps:
Continue to improve my skills so this portfolio looks better and hopefully showcases myself well to future employment opportunities. 
More thorough thought process will need to be put in and laid out how it will present me best hence it is quite possible for this all to be updated dramatically.
