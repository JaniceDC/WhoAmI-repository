            <h1>Here's a little about me...</h1>
                <p>I am in the middle of a career transformation. <br> 
                    Never in my wildest thoughts that I thought I would be embarking on a journey to become a programmer. </p>
                <p> All my life to date, I have always been told what I should do, what is the better choice to make, and even 'you brain is just not wired that way', but I never really know what I like to do. </p>        <p>After plentiful of soul searching and self help books, I decided that I am ready to find that one thing that sparks joy for me to do. 
                    I have always been good at what do no matter the job I held, not because I have a neck for it nor because I love it. <br> 
                    The one simple reason is: I refuse to be crap at what I do. </p>
                <p>Being a parent and trying to be a decent one no small task. I am thankful that my 2 gorgeous young boys taught me a very important life lesson. 
                    It is never too late and I am free to express my passion in life. (well.. at least career wise) As they say, 'If you love what you do, you will never work a day in your life.'</p>
                <p>So here I am, a bag of nerves and self frustration with the support of my dear family. <br>
                    The journey has begun... and I feel like I am under the Northern Lights. </p>
